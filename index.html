Welcome! 


I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in [the Population Research Center](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/prc/) at the University of Texas at Austin 


and a research affiliate of [the Population Wellbeing Initiative](https://sites.utexas.edu/pwi/). 



My primary fields of interest are labor economics and demography.
