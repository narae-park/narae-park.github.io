Welcome! 

I am an Associate Research Fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade ([KIET](https://www.kiet.re.kr)). 

My primary fields of interest are demography, health economics, and labor economics. More specifically, I study the interactions between socio-economic factors and demographic characteristics, focusing on aspects like fertility and health outcomes.

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Michigan State University and my B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Hanyang University. 

My CV is available [here](assets/cv/cv_parkn.pdf) (Last Updated: November 2024).
