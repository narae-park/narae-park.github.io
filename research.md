## Working Papers
* [Credit Supply Shocks and Fertility: Long-Term Consequences](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7xGQ5n1e8XIMjHAyZnBrnejr586jx3N/view?usp=share_link) (with Bokyung Kim and Minseog Kim)

    The Great Recession marked a beginning of a historic downward trend for fertility rates in the US. However, little is known about the role of credit supply shocks in explaining these declines. This study investigates whether and to what extent negative credit supply shocks decrease fertility rates. We construct county-level credit supply shocks using variation in year-to-year changes in loans for small businesses and home mortgages. Using these exogenous shocks derived from Bartik (1991)’s shift-share measure, we find that negative credit supply shocks decrease fertility rates both in the short and long run. Counties experienced an average-sized credit reduction in 2009 have had a long-term decrease in fertility rates by 3.17% between 2009–2019. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals that Whites and those aged under 30 decrease their fertility the most in response to negative credit shocks. The findings of this study highlight that credit supply is a key factor influencing fertility choices and that negative credit supply shocks can have long-lasting adverse impacts on fertility rates.

  
* [Is There a Child Penalty in South Korea?](/assets/papers/naraepark_childpenalty.pdf)
  
  In many countries, the child penalty, which is the loss in earnings associated with childbirth, is large and persistent for mothers. In this study, I estimate the effect of a first birth on the labor market outcomes in South Korea (hereafter Korea) over time using a method proposed by Kleven, Landais, and Søgaard (2019b). First, I find that Korean women experience a substantial penalty in earnings with a first childbirth compared to women in other countries. Second, while the child penalty in other countries comes from both the intensive and extensive margins, the penalty for Korean women arises almost exclusively on the extensive margin. Third, I find a substantial drop in earnings for mothers even before the child is born. Finally, to shed light on the source of the child penalty, I examine several of its correlates, including marriage, the lack of work benefits, and opportunity costs.

* Heterogeneous Effects of Volunteering on Frailty in Later Life: A Panel Quantile Regression Approach (with Sae Hwang Han) *R&R at the Journals of Gerontology: Series B*

    Decades of research indicate that volunteering is associated with better health for the volunteer beyond the selection effects based on health. However, little is known about potential heterogeneity in health outcomes associated with volunteering in the context of good or poor health. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the frailty index (FI) to investigate the volunteering-health nexus across the population frailty distribution ranging from fit to frail. Using nationally representative data from the Health and Retirement Study, we estimated unconditional quantile regression models with panel fixed effects to estimate changes in FI associated with changes in the share of volunteers in the population across the frailty distribution observed across the study period (1998–2020). Our findings demonstrated that the volunteering–FI association was heterogeneous across the frailty distribution. The association was the most potent at the higher end of the frailty distribution, suggesting that efforts to promote volunteering may yield greater benefits for older adults experiencing high levels of frailty.
